XML Basics

Homework

1. What does the XML language represent? What is it used for?
	XML means EXtensible Markup Language and is pretty much like HTML.
	The data itself is self-described and self-defined. It is well formed
	and thus XML parser could easily read and understand it. Elements are
	the building blocks of the XML. They are enclosed by open and close tag.
	It is designed to focuses on documents but it's widely used to store and
	transport data over the internet.
2. Create XML document students.xml, which contains structured description of students.
	For each student you should enter information for his name, sex, birth date, phone, email, course, specialty, faculty number and a list of taken exams (exam name, tutor, score).
3. What do namespaces represent in an XML document? What are they used for?
	XML Namespaces enable the same document to contain XML elements and attributes
	taken from different vocabularies, without any naming collisions occurring.
	Although XML Namespaces are not part of the XML specification itself, virtually
	all XML software also supports XML Namespaces.
4. Explore http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier to learn more about URI, URN and URL definitions.
5. Add default namespace for students "urn:students".
6. Create XSD Schema for students.xml document.
	Add new elements in the schema: information for enrollment (date and exam score) and teacher's endorsements.
7. Write an XSL stylesheet to visualize the students as HTML.
	Test it in your favourite browser.
