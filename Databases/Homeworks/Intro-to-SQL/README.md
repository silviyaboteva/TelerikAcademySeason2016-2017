Structured Query Language (SQL)

Homework

1. What is SQL? What is DML? What is DDL? Recite the most important SQL commands.
	 - SQL (Structured Query Language) is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a relational
	database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).

	 - A data manipulation language (DML) is a family of syntax elements similar to a computer programming language used for selecting,
	inserting, deleting and updating data in a database. Performing read-only queries of data is sometimes also considered a component of DML.
	
	 - A data definition language or data description language (DDL) is a syntax similar to a computer programming language for defining 
	data structures, especially database schemas.
	
	 - SQL SELECT
	 - SQL WHERE
	 - SQL AND OR
	 - SQL IN
	 - SQL BETWEEN
	 - SQL ORDER BY
	 - SQL GROUP BY
	 - SQL HAVING
	 - SQL AS
	 - SQL SELECT UNIQUE
	 - SQL INSERT INTO
	 - SQL UPDATE
	 - SQL DELETE FROM
2. What is Transact-SQL (T-SQL)?
	 - Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is Microsoft's and Sybase's proprietary extension to the SQL (Structured Query Language) used to interact with relational
	databases. T-SQL expands on the SQL standard to include procedural programming, local variables, various support functions for string
	processing, date processing, mathematics, etc. and changes to the DELETE and UPDATE statements.
